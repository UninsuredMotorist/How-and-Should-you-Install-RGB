# How-Should-you-Install-RGB
*I'll answer the second question right off the start, you absolutely should install RGB. Go do it. Like, now.*

Anyway, you've got two choices for installing it: power 'directly' from battery, or from an outlet in the cabin. There are some pros and cons to each option.

### 'Directly' from Battery
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Pros</th>
        <td>Less visible wiring, kits with this kind of connection tend to be of higher quality</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Cons</th>
        <td>More scary to do, higher PfFFUs (possibility for fatal fuck ups)</td>
    </tr>
</table>

If you really want a "clean" look this offers you that as the wires for you're exterior can stay outside and be tucked into the engine bay and fit right in with the other wires most of us have no idea about. You'll probably be paying either a bit more a ton less to connect them this way as kits that make it easy tend to cost more and because of that are pretty decent quality, or you're stripping the wires on cheapo RGB kits and bumbing up that PfFFU score. If you're doing it that way you've definitely got the confidence to overcome the scary factor, but it's going to maybe make a 30min max job into a couple-hours-at-least job. With either of the options do keep in mind that you'll need to buy lights that are waterproof if you're tossing them outside the cabin.

### From Outlet
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Pros</th>
        <td>Pros: Can be cheaper, easier</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Cons</th>
        <td>Cons: visible wiring (I love the look tho), buying a ton of extra wires.</td>
    </tr>

Some of you nerdy fucks, or those who liked cyberpunk, like me will have no problem (I actually prefer it). There are kits with 12V adapters anywhere, I bought mine at Canadian Tire, and so long as you've got at least one plug in you should be good. If you've got a miata that could be a problem, but my XC90s got ports everywhere and just choosing one was more of a problem. I've used this method to throw lights on the outside of the car as well, I did it with a huge 12V converter thing [image] and a metric fuckton of USB extension cords and insulating stuff for weather protection. No real complaints though, was just like playing with lego.

### Installation
If you use a kit meant to be used for car underglow it will be super simple, just follow the instructions and plug the things into where the things look like they'll fit. You'll get a bunch of lights to stick under the car, a ton of long wires, and probably a couple plugs to put into the fuze box, just google where to plug them or hit up the forums or reddit. If you're a cheapo like me you'll pick up a random amazon kit that says they're waterproof and have to buy a ton of USB extension cables to get them to run to inside of your cabin.

The only con I can think of to doing this is that cops seem to really like the pretty lights, and they also seem to induce BS claims of impersonating officers. Just try to avoid red and blue hues and you're fine, in my experience pink tends to fly fine. Always read reviews, in one of the kits I bought the remote stopped working about a week after, kinda works but is stuck in horny-red.

Anything for personalization should be done imo (we can argue about truck nuts another time), and lights make any car look like 1000% cooler (and getting ur cheeks clapped is a lot more fun with music-syncing lights just fyi).
